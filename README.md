# Terraform
#What is Terraform
 HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version,   reuse, and share.

#How does terraform works?
 Terraform creates and manages resources on cloud platforms and other services through their application programming interfaces (APIs). Providers enable Terraform to   work with virtually any platform or service with an accessible API.
